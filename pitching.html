            <h1>Pitching Analysis</h1>
            <p>After we started with two new data collection devices, FlightScope and Rapsodo, there was an extreme amount of data that the coaches did not know how to use.  This information overflow made it hard for them to parse through the data and look at numnbers they wanted to analyze.  The pitchign coach and vido coordiator approached me with this issue and requested an excel file that does easy calculations on a limited number of the data sets.  In response I created a macro based excel file that allowed the pitching coach to look more closely at the data and analyze it based on pitcher, date, and more.</p>
