            <h1>Spin and Velocity</h1>
            <p>I am currently researching pitch spin for pitchers and exit velocity for hitters.  These are two of the main measurements the coaches look at on a daily basis and with almost three years of data for me to look at I have decided to look at the change in these metrics throughout a season.  I hope to find a relationship of when pitchers and hitters are at their best performance levels in order to adjust routines to make sure when they are at their best it is at the right time in the season.</p>
